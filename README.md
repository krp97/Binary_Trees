# Binary_Trees

## Project description

**Data Structures** is a follow up project to **[Basic Data Structures](https://github.com/krp97/Basic-Data-Structures)** which complements the implementation with Binary Trees:
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree (Adelson-Velskii and Landis)
* Red and Black Tree

Each binary tree is a standalone structure, which only requires it's corresponding node structure to work. They have been gathered under one project, 

All three trees provide a similar API which consists of:
* Insertion
* Removal
* Preorder / Inorder / Postorder traversal
* Max / Min key search

AVL and R&B also provide methods which determine characteristics specific to their implementations:
* AVL:
	* Tree/Subtree height.
* R&B:
	* Number of black passes.
