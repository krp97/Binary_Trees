# Binary_Trees

## Project description

**Binary Trees** is a follow up project to **[Basic Data Structures](https://github.com/krp97/Basic-Data-Structures)** which complements the implementation with Binary Trees:
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree (Adelson-Velskii and Landis)

Each binary tree is a standalone structure, which only requires it's corresponding node structure to work. They have been gathered under one project, 

All three trees provide a similar API which consists of:
* Insertion
* Removal
* Preorder / Inorder / Postorder traversal
* Max / Min key search

AVL also provides a method which determine characteristics specific to it's implementations:
* AVL:
	* Tree/Subtree height.
